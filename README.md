## Abstract
A neural network may be geometrically interpreted as nonlinear function that stretches and pulls apart data between vector spaces. If a dataset has interesting geometric or topological structure, one might ask how the structure of the data will change when passed through a neural network. This is achieved by explicitly viewing the dataset as a manifold and observing how the topological complexity (i.e., the sum of the Betti numbers) of the manifold changes as it passes through the activation layers of a neural network. 

The goal of this project is to study how the topological complexity of the data changes by tuning the hyper-parameters of the network. This enables us to possibly understand the relationship between the structural mechanics of the network and its performance.
